## Program Usage:
This program will reads files character by character and printing out the position of each character followed by the character.
1. When the program starts, it will prompt you for a file name. Enter the file name of a text file which you want the program to read and display.
2. If the file exists, the contents of the file will be displayed. If the file does not exist, you will be asked to enter a valid file name.
3. Once a file is read and displayed, you will be asked if you want to read another file or if you would like to terminate the program. To read another file, press enter. Otherwise, type "quit" or "exit" (case sensitive) to terminate the program.
